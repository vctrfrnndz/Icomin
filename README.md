## Generated with Icomoon

Open **demo.html** to see a list of all the glyphs in your font along with their codes/ligatures.

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

You can import **selection.json** back to the IcoMoon app to retrieve your icon selection.
